Free Code Camp Project - Local Weather App

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: [http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV/).

1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
