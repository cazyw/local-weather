# Local Weather App
Free Code Camp Intermediate Project - Local Weather App

## Objective and Discussion

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: [http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV/).

1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Completed - [Local Weather App](https://cazyw.github.io/localWeather/)

After the user's location has been identified, weather data was called from the Free Code Camp Weather API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. If location is not turned on or cannot be found, a message will be displayed.
